Project Overview

This project aims to collect and store structured data from websites using a Python-based web scraper. The data is stored in a PostgreSQL database, ensuring a robust and scalable backend. Future iterations will include a user-friendly front-end interface to visualize and interact with the data.

Features

Web Scraping: Extracts dynamic data from specified websites.

PostgreSQL Integration: Stores data in a relational database for efficient querying.

Extensible Design: Planned integration of a front-end for data visualization and interaction.

Technologies Used

Python: For web scraping using libraries such as requests, BeautifulSoup, or Selenium.

PostgreSQL: For relational data storage.

HTML/CSS/JavaScript (Planned): For the front-end interface.

Getting Started

Prerequisites

Python 3.7+

PostgreSQL installed and running

pip for managing Python packages

Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_project.git
cd your_project

Install required Python packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Set up the PostgreSQL database:

Create a database using your PostgreSQL client.

Update the config.py file with your database credentials.

Usage

Running the Scraper

Navigate to the scraper directory:

cd scraper

Run the scraping script:

python scraper.py

Database Setup

Execute the schema file to set up the database:

psql -U your_username -d your_database -f database/schema.sql

Verify the database connection by running the db_operations.py script:

python database/db_operations.py

Future Front-End Integration

The front-end development will be added in future iterations. Stay tuned for updates!
